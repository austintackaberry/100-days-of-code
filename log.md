# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0, July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned Git, GitHub, started cs50 pset8

**Thoughts:** Excited to start 100 days of code!

### Day 1: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading cs50 pset8

**Thoughts**: This pset looks really long and complicated but also really cool!

### Day 2: July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended CodeClub meetup, learned about branches in GitHub and a little bit of Ruby

**Thoughts**: Really need to learn my way around the command line more, so that I can navigate around Ubuntu more efficiently

### Day 3: July 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started The Odin Project! Learned how the internet works, learned more about git and GitHub, installed a bunch of stuff to start programming Ruby!

**Thoughts**: Not sure how I feel about learning Ruby vs Python for back end in general, but I am excited to learn Ruby to contribute to CodeClub meetup projects which will be done in Ruby.

### Day 4: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Chugging along on The Odin Project, getting more comfortable with git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

**Thoughts**: Still not entirely sure why the staging area is a useful feature in git. Someone on reddit recommended to minimize the copy-pasting when doing tutorials in order to help learn more quickly. I have been doing this, and I think it is great advice.

### Day 5: July 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended FreeCodeCamp meetup in Oakland, met some cool people, quit The Odin Project, started FreeCode Camp

**Thoughts**: Made some quick, important decisions today...Realized that Javascript is much more popular than Ruby for web development as of late (via indeed.com, reddit, and podcasts), thus the switch from The Odin Project to FCC. Plus, there is a weekly 6 hour FCC meetup in Oakland!

### Day 6: July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some solid progress on cs50 pset8. Almost done!

**Thoughts**: I'm all over the place...not sure if I should completely finish cs50 before digging into FCC or if I should just finish pset8 and leave the final project for later when I am more familiar with Javascript/HTML/CSS. It would be nice to finish cs50 and get it out of the way, but it would also be nice to have my final project be decent!

### Day 7: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished cs50 pset8!!

**Thoughts**: Feeling accomplished. I think I am going to go back to FreeCodeCamp until I feel capable of making my own cool project that I will use for cs50 Final Project.

### Day 8: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through HTML and CSS in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: I have heard good things about FreeCodeCamp, but I will say that I wish the challenges were more difficult. Because the answers are nearly spoon-fed, I don't feel like I am retaining as much as I could have. I am looking forward to the projects and developing a proficiency in HTML/CSS!

### Day 9: July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Participated in CodeClub meetup where we decided that we will focus on Javascript/CSS/HTML for our projects. Completed the HTML/CSS section of FCC and started Bootstrap.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap seems helpful and makes CSS manageable. I can't wait to get to Javascript and the first projects! Also glad that there is an Oakland FCC meetup to learn with others.

### Day 10: July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Bootstrap and jQuery sections of FCC. Read the first FCC project.

**Thoughts**: Excited to be working on projects! Really hope I can use my own IDE rather than codepen. I want to get comfortable working on my own setup and using git/github. Unfortunately, I won't be able to code tomorrow as I will be mountaineering at Mt. Shasta!

### Day 11: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started my first FCC project, making a tribute page for Craig Newmark.

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately, I was unable to code the last 3 days due to
mountaineering at Mt. Shasta (awesome experience) over the weekend and going
 to the A's game yesterday. I almost decided to not do the FCC projects but
 do my own projects, so that my portfolio is unique, but after googling others'
 experiences with FCC, the response is overwhelmingly positive. It is hard to
 find someone that has something negative to say about FCC. Then, I thought
 about doing FCC beta based on what I was reading on reddit, but they are no
 longer accepting new campers, so I decided to stick to the normal FCC.

### Day 12: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the tribute page. Started and almost finished my portfolio webpage!

**Thoughts**: I thought I understood CSS/Bootstrap when I was going through the
 FCC curriculum, but these projects have revealed some misunderstandings. Today I
 decided that my goal is to be employed one year after I started learning
 how to program (May 27, 2017) making the same pay as I do now.
 
 ### Day 13: August 3, 2017
 
 **Today's Progress**: Made minor changes to Portfolio webpage, made some solid progress on the Basic Javascript section.
 
 **Thoughts**: I can't wait until I get past the syntax and start doing cool stuff with Javascript. I also still need to add a nav bar to my portfolio page and then copy/paste my code into codepen. It's crazy that I've only been coding for a little less than 10 weeks. It feels like that was so long ago!
 
 ### Day 14: August 4, 2017
 
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Javascript section, 70% done with Basic Algorithm Scripting section, organized a CodeClub meetup for Sunday, August 6th.
 
 **Thoughts**: Wondering when I should start writing blogposts, learning DS&A, contributing to open source projects, etc. Even though I still have 9 months to achieve my goal, I still feel like I am far from being employable.
 
 ### Day 15: August 5, 2017
 
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting Section and JSON APIs and AJAX Section. Messed around with Vim and Atom.
 
 **Thoughts**: After reading about different text editors/IDEs, I figured I'd give Vim a try. I really like the keyboard shortcuts, but at this point I think I need to focus on my code rather than figuring out how to use Vim. After messing around with Atom, I think I am going to make the switch from Intellij Idea. I like that Atom is open source and doesn't block certain packages unless you pay.

### Day 16: August 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed random quote generator and local weather web application.

**Thoughts**: Using javascript to make dynamic webpages is pretty neat. I think I should start a blog to document my journey of learning to code. I really want to get into the back-end already! I feel like I keep putting off actually utilizing bootstrap; I would like to make attractive webpages, but it seems time-consuming. The CodeClub meetup today was a bust. Note to self: give members more than 2 days notice for a meetup.

### Day 17: August 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed wikipedia viewer project.

**Thoughts**: Hit my first real snag in FCC. I was essentially trying to use ajax data before it was sent to me. After a lot of googling and getting nowhere I decided to try to return a function that did something with the ajax data. This forced the ajax request to finish before using the data. My webpages aren't pretty, but they fulfill the user stories. I plan on coming back and touching them up, though I'm not sure when I'm going to commit to really learning CSS!

### Day 18: August 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed 25% of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Section.

**Thoughts**: Decided to take a light day...wasn't feeling like doing the twitch project, so I skipped ahead to the Intermediate Algorithms. Asked a question on reddit whether or not I should worry about making my projects pretty at this stage, and the consensus seemed to be yes, I should be spending time growing my CSS competence and making my projects pretty. My problem is that I often feel accomplished when I fulfill the user stories and don't have any drive to go back and touch it up. I feel like I should be documenting my progress through a blog or something.

### Day 19: August 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went to oakland.js meetup and began Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I read on reddit that people recommended following along with Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp while doing FreeCodeCamp, so I am in the process of getting up to speed on Colt's program. I am glad I went to the oakland.js meetup this week, met some cool people and had some cool discussions about javascript and web development. I saw a porfolio of someone who recently finished a bootcamp, and I realized how far away I am...but it's motivating! I only worry that I have a lack of focus given that I am working on CodeClub, FreeCodeCamp, and Colt Steele's bootcamp.

### Day 20: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went to CodeClub meetup, planned a meetup for 9/3, finished a couple intermediate algorithm problems, completed twitch web app

**Thoughts**: Didn't really socialize too much at the meetup, just put my head down and cranked out some algorithms. I'm hoping that people will RSVP for my 9/3 meetup given that there is plenty of time for people to see it and plan for it. The asynchronous nature of javascript continues to trip me up. I originally wanted to obtain all the information from twitch synchronously and then send it to the DOM. I realized it was better to build the skeleton into the DOM, so that all the API calls could be asynchronous without changing the DOM unpredictably depending on which calls finished first. Wondering if I should crunch away at freecodecamp or shift over to Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp.

### Day 21: August 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished a couple more intermediate algorithm problems, some advanced algorithm problems, and watched the HTML and some CSS sections of Colt Steele's The Web Developer's Bootcamp (WDB)

**Thoughts**: Holding off on some of the intermediate algorithm problems because a fellow FCC camper wanted to do pair programming on some of them. I agree with many people in that WDB is a good supplement for FCC. I find that in FCC I just hack away until I fulfill the user stories not knowing if my code is being done the "right" way. WDB walks through code explaining why things should be done a certain way. Also, WDB uses a real text editor (Sublime) rather than codepen, so it is less hand-holding in that regard. I have also found that the difficult part of completing the algorithms is not just completing them, but completing them in a non-brute force, elegant manner. I try to make my solutions somewhere in between brute force and optimized, so that I am learning but not wasting too much time.

### Day 22: August 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started blogging about my first day coding and my journey through cs50. Continued the advanced algorithm scripting in FCC.

**Thoughts**: There has been a voice in my head telling me I should capture my journey through text moreso than just with this log, and today I finally turned that voice into action. I wrote down why I started to learn to code and why I made some of the decisions that I did. Quincy Larson said that there are a lot of blogs on the "Hello World" level and a lot on the advanced level, but not a lot in between. Hopefully my blog (when I do publish it) will be useful to someone who is teaching him/herself to code. For now I will keep my "blog" private, but I did post part of it to reddit today. "No repeats please" advanced algorithm problem was difficult. It was especially frustrating when my code was correct, but I couldn't get the test to pass! I realized that it doesn't like global variables and quickly resolved the issue. Today was my first time using recursion on FCC. I tried to figure out the math solution for a good hour or two and then gave up. I only have 3 advanced algorithm problems left!

### Day 23: August 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started reading "You don't know javascipt" up to "Scope & Closures Chapter 2: Lexical Scope", made solid progress on the tic tac toe project in FCC.

**Thoughts**: I didn't have a ton of time today because I was travelling all day, but I still made some solid progress! The tic-tac-toe game is way more lines of code than it needs to be, but it is only a few finishing touches away from fulfilling the user stories. You Don't Know Javscipt seems to be the phrase that applies to you after you're done reading the book. It is dense. I don't think I am far enough along to really grasp the material, but it is good to get exposed to it. When closures, promises, callbacks come up later, it won't be the first time that I have heard of them. The podcasts I listen to talk about this stuff too, so it's nice to learn about it a little, so that I can understand more of the podcasts I listen to. I think I am getting to the point where I have too much going on: FCC, CodeClub, YDKJS, CSWDB, blogging. That's a lot. I'm going to have to get more focused. I also decided today that I want to live code on twitch at some point.

### Day 24: August 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished some more intermediate algorthm scripting problems

**Thoughts**: I only have 5 intermediate and 3 advanced algorithm scripting problems left! If you go by the number of hours that FCC says it is supposed to take to do each section, then I am 62% done with the front end certification. Still a long way to go, but I can't believe I have come this far in really only 16 days.

### Day 25: August 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished a couple more intermediate algorithm scripting problems

**Thoughts**: Just read about the p1xt guide which recommends against doing the FCC front end program...

### Day 26: August 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the intermediate algorithm scripting section

**Thoughts**: today is my birthday, yay

### Day 27: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 more advanced algorithm scripting problems. Only one more to go!

**Thoughts**: And the last one is a doozy. I finally need to learn this and closures. I tried reading those sections of YDKJS and I'm still confused. I'll try again tomorrow!

### Day 28: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read some more YDKJS while on the plane travelling back home and finished the advanced algorithm scipting section!

**Thoughts**: Now the only thing standing between me and the Front End Certification is the Advanced Front End Development Project Section! Then I'll have to decide which certification I'll aim for next...I was going to dive into React, but now I'm not sure if I should after all the licensing issues...

### Day 29: August 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fulfilled user stories for tic tac toe and javascipt calculator projects in FCC

**Thoughts**: Thinking I should catch up on WDB and try to find out how to use the material I am learning from YDKJS

### Day 30: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fulfilled user stories for pomodoro clock project

**Thoughts**: Only one more project left for the front end certification!

### Day 31: August 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fulfilled user stories for the simon project

**Thoughts**: Now I just need to find out a way to submit my projects to FCC...Looks like I need to make a separate repo for each project if I want to use GitHub Pages...

### Day 32: August 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made GitHub repos for each of my FCC projects and made GitHub Pages for each of those, so that I could submit them to FCC.....and get my front end certification! Started looking into how I should learn React. I also watched some WDB, I'm currently on lecture 60.

**Thoughts**: Excited to finally begin learning React! Though again that licensing issue makes me worry a bit...not enough to choose a different framework though.

### Day 33: August 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began Facebook's react.js tutorial and attended javascript meetup

**Thoughts**: I hope that I can learn react by doing Facebook's tutorial and reading through the documentation. It doesn't seem like there are many good free courses. I think I would like to learn React then Node and then start contributing to open source software.

### Day 34: August 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through facebook react tutorial, started egghead.io react tutorial

**Thoughts**: Learning react has been much more difficult than HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Javascript/jQuery. There isn't as much free material on the web, and you need to understand more advanced javascript concepts. "this" is still difficult for me to understand. Hopefully I can find a supplement to YDKJS.

### Day 35: August 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read YDKJS sections on `this`, hacked on YDKJS `this` code, and tried to use that to understand what all the `this`s are doing in the facebook react code.

**Thoughts**: I am making progress on understanding the facebook react tutorial, but it is taking time. I am hoping that I can use YDKJS to fully understand the facebook react tutorial code.

### Day 36: August 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went to Oakland FCC meetup, but spent the whole time trying to fix my ubuntu slow boot issue. Continued learning about `this` and classes. I had an 'aha' moment when I realized the structures inside of the React Components were methods and not functions...all of a sudden `this` made a lot more sense in the React tutorial code. This made me realize that I should read YDKJS cover to cover before learning React. I also learned today that it is possible that my SSD is dying...to buy a new laptop or get a new SSD and learn how to install it...

### Day 37: August 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning `this` in YDKJS. Set up the babel transpiler, so that I can code along with YDKJS in ES6, and see the results on the browser.

**Thoughts**: Learning `this` with YDKJS is taking a long time, but I know that going through YDKJS and following along with the example code will better prepare me in the long run. I am getting antsy...I want to get going on those FCC react apps.

### Day 38: August 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Moved on to the Objects section of YDKJS. Next step is learning classes.

**Thoughts**: Progress seems slow, but I am focused which is a good thing.

### Day 39: August 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended CodeClub meetup and learned how the CodeClub website is set up

**Thoughts**: It would be cool to use react on the CodeClub website, but I'm not sure if it's necessary or when it would be most useful.

### Day 40: September 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read about classes in ydkjs

**Thoughts**: I need to pick up the pace..I feel like I have been wasting time the last week or so. I'm going to hit it hard tomorrow.

### Day 41: September 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading about `class`es and `prototype` in ydkjs until I got bored/tired and watched a couple CSWDB videos (currently on lecture 65).

**Thoughts**: I am hosting a CodeClub meetup tomorrow, and I think I am going to take another stab at React tomorrow.

### Day 42: September 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Hosted CodeClub meetup, added "how to contribute" page to CodeClub dev repo, and started/finished my first react app

**Thoughts**: I got a lot done today. I'm happy that I finally contributed to the CodeClub website; hopefully I can get more into it and make more meaningful contributions. It seems like it's really good experience learning how to use Git on a team. Even though I don't fully understand all of the javascript fundamentals, I am glad that I decided to dive in and make my first react app. I think I will plan to finish the freecodecamp react projects, and then later read back through ydkjs. That way I will have some context, and the content will (hopefully) stick in my head a little better. Tomorrow I am planning on make monthly goals to make sure that I am on track with my progress.

### Day 43: September 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some solid progress on the next react app on the FCC data visualization track. Also, made a monthly goals onenote page, so that I ensure that I have short term goals that help me meet my long term goal.

**Thoughts**: I am really glad that I decided to make the short term goals onenote because it is really easy to fall behind without knowing it when you don't have milestones along the way.

### Day 44: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Watched some more CSWDB videos, up to lecture 72 now. Completed the FCC leaderboard project, learned how to build react in an existing web app, used react and the meetup API to display info about the next meetup on the index page of codeclub.social

**Thoughts**: I am glad that I am watching the CSWDB videos. I am now up to the Bootstrap section which made me realize that I have not used Bootstrap in any of my projects thus far. I should probably go back through my projects, and give the CSS some attention, apply the Bootstrap knowledge that I obtained from CSWDB. It was a very productive night, but I should try to go to bed before midnight going forward...preferrably before 10:30PM...This was one of those days where I felt very accomplished by the end. I enjoy working on codeclub.social; however, I also really like the structure of FCC.

### Day 45: September 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went to oakland.js meetup, worked on trying to get the meetup RSVP button to work on codeclub.social

**Thoughts**: I don't know why I can't get the POST request to work with the meetup API, but hopefully I will get some help at the codeclub meetup tomorrow.

### Day 46: September 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended CodeClub meetup and continued working on meetup API for CodeClub

**Thoughts**: Didn't make it out to the sudoroom for javascript night, hoping to make it next week. Still not sure why this oauth2 post request isn't working with the meetup api. I'll try again tomorrow...

### Day 47: September 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally got the meetup rsvp button to work on codeclub.social! I merged with dev. Now when the user goes to the index page, he/she can get information about the next meetup, rsvp to the next meetup, and then there will be a message saying that the user did in fact rsvp.

**Thoughts**: The issue with the authentication had something to do with the html form I was using as a button to log in. As soon as I made it an anchor tag, it worked right away. I did something with cookies for the first time which was pretty neat. Overall, I feel pretty accomplished. Perhaps, I should add some more functionality and make it pretty, so that I make it something I am proud of.

### Day 48: September 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up the react meetup api code a bit, made it into a bootstrap card on Brian's suggestion

**Thoughts**: I think I am going to make a card for each of the next 3 meetups. This will make the log ins a little more complicated but it shouldn't be too bad. I am also planning on working on the FCC react recipe box tomorrow. It would probably be a good idea to make a medium post twice a month or so. Maybe I will start that tomorrow as well.

### Day 49: September 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made bootstrap cards for the next 3 meeetups. Working on getting the RSVP buttons functional.

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately I was unable to code the last 2 days due to personal circumstances, but I am back at it. As soon as I get the 3 RSVP buttons to work, I will work on the next FCC React project. As for the medium post, I may want to make my own blog site...

### Day 50: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the RSVP buttons

**Thoughts**: Finally got the RSVP buttons to work! I haven't pushed to dev yet, but the user can now see the next 3 meetups and RSVP to any/all of them after logging in to meetup. Ready to move on to the next React project in FCC! Though I think I should go over the FB tutorial again...I feel like I am under-utilizing props.

### Day 51: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished RSVP buttons, cleaned up the code, pushed to dev, and attended CodeClub meetup

**Thoughts**: Ready to get back to the FCC React projects and try to code the React way rather than the hacky way. Recently I have not been coding as much, and I need to kick it back into high gear if I want to meet my goal.

### Day 52: September 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started recipe box project, began the design using bootstrap

**Thoughts**: Ready to start using bootstrap and making my websites cleaner. This seems like a good project to get more familiar with the React lifecycle.

### Day 53: September 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing work on recipe box

**Thoughts**: Didn't have much time to work on this today, but I'm ready to get right back into it tomorrow

### Day 54: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished recipe box, started the game of life

**Thoughts**: Seems like this project will take a little bit longer than the other ones. I really want to move to the back end contribute some more to CodeClub! Also, I want to find a better way to meet other web developers near my level.

### Day 55: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the game of life working

**Thoughts**: I really want the chart to work out. That would be a cool feature, but I don't think the chart js react library was made to be updated every second...it's doing some weird things to my timer. Thinking about forgetting about the chart and moving on.

### Day 56: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I figured out the issue and got the chart to work. There are still some glitches, but form reading the github issues, it seems like there are some bugs in the library.

**Thoughts**: I am ready to move on past this project, but I am not quite done yet. Turns out the problem had to do with me running this.setState() more than once in componentDidUpdate(), so basically I had an open control loop that was opening an exponential amount of setState lifecycles. I was causing an exponentially infinite loop, so that's pretty neat.
