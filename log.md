# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0, July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned Git, GitHub, started cs50 pset8

**Thoughts:** Excited to start 100 days of code!

### Day 1: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading cs50 pset8

**Thoughts**: This pset looks really long and complicated but also really cool!

### Day 2: July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended CodeClub meetup, learned about branches in GitHub and a little bit of Ruby

**Thoughts**: Really need to learn my way around the command line more, so that I can navigate around Ubuntu more efficiently

### Day 3: July 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started The Odin Project! Learned how the internet works, learned more about git and GitHub, installed a bunch of stuff to start programming Ruby!

**Thoughts**: Not sure how I feel about learning Ruby vs Python for back end in general, but I am excited to learn Ruby to contribute to CodeClub meetup projects which will be done in Ruby.

### Day 4: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Chugging along on The Odin Project, getting more comfortable with git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

**Thoughts**: Still not entirely sure why the staging area is a useful feature in git. Someone on reddit recommended to minimize the copy-pasting when doing tutorials in order to help learn more quickly. I have been doing this, and I think it is great advice.

### Day 5: July 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended FreeCodeCamp meetup in Oakland, met some cool people, quit The Odin Project, started FreeCode Camp

**Thoughts**: Made some quick, important decisions today...Realized that Javascript is much more popular than Ruby for web development as of late (via indeed.com, reddit, and podcasts), thus the switch from The Odin Project to FCC. Plus, there is a weekly 6 hour FCC meetup in Oakland!

### Day 6: July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some solid progress on cs50 pset8. Almost done!

**Thoughts**: I'm all over the place...not sure if I should completely finish cs50 before digging into FCC or if I should just finish pset8 and leave the final project for later when I am more familiar with Javascript/HTML/CSS. It would be nice to finish cs50 and get it out of the way, but it would also be nice to have my final project be decent!
