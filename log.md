# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 52, July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned Git, GitHub, started cs50 pset8

**Thoughts:** Excited to start 100 days of code!

### Day 53: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading cs50 pset8

**Thoughts**: This pset looks really long and complicated but also really cool!

### Day 54: July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended CodeClub meetup, learned about branches in GitHub and a little bit of Ruby

**Thoughts**: Really need to learn my way around the command line more, so that I can navigate around Ubuntu more efficiently

### Day 55: July 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started The Odin Project! Learned how the internet works, learned more about git and GitHub, installed a bunch of stuff to start programming Ruby!

**Thoughts**: Not sure how I feel about learning Ruby vs Python for back end in general, but I am excited to learn Ruby to contribute to CodeClub meetup projects which will be done in Ruby.

### Day 56: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Chugging along on The Odin Project, getting more comfortable with git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

**Thoughts**: Still not entirely sure why the staging area is a useful feature in git. Someone on reddit recommended to minimize the copy-pasting when doing tutorials in order to help learn more quickly. I have been doing this, and I think it is great advice.

### Day 57: July 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended FreeCodeCamp meetup in Oakland, met some cool people, quit The Odin Project, started FreeCode Camp

**Thoughts**: Made some quick, important decisions today...Realized that Javascript is much more popular than Ruby for web development as of late (via indeed.com, reddit, and podcasts), thus the switch from The Odin Project to FCC. Plus, there is a weekly 6 hour FCC meetup in Oakland!

### Day 58: July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some solid progress on cs50 pset8. Almost done!

**Thoughts**: I'm all over the place...not sure if I should completely finish cs50 before digging into FCC or if I should just finish pset8 and leave the final project for later when I am more familiar with Javascript/HTML/CSS. It would be nice to finish cs50 and get it out of the way, but it would also be nice to have my final project be decent!

### Day 59: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished cs50 pset8!!

**Thoughts**: Feeling accomplished. I think I am going to go back to FreeCodeCamp until I feel capable of making my own cool project that I will use for cs50 Final Project.

### Day 60: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through HTML and CSS in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: I have heard good things about FreeCodeCamp, but I will say that I wish the challenges were more difficult. Because the answers are nearly spoon-fed, I don't feel like I am retaining as much as I could have. I am looking forward to the projects and developing a proficiency in HTML/CSS!

### Day 61: July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Participated in CodeClub meetup where we decided that we will focus on Javascript/CSS/HTML for our projects. Completed the HTML/CSS section of FCC and started Bootstrap.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap seems helpful and makes CSS manageable. I can't wait to get to Javascript and the first projects! Also glad that there is an Oakland FCC meetup to learn with others.

### Day 62: July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Bootstrap and jQuery sections of FCC. Read the first FCC project.

**Thoughts**: Excited to be working on projects! Really hope I can use my own IDE rather than codepen. I want to get comfortable working on my own setup and using git/github. Unfortunately, I won't be able to code tomorrow as I will be mountaineering at Mt. Shasta!

### Day 66: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started my first FCC project, making a tribute page for Craig Newmark.

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately, I was unable to code the last 3 days due to
mountaineering at Mt. Shasta (awesome experience) over the weekend and going
 to the A's game yesterday. I almost decided to not do the FCC projects but
 do my own projects, so that my portfolio is unique, but after googling others'
 experiences with FCC, the response is overwhelmingly positive. It is hard to
 find someone that has something negative to say about FCC. Then, I thought
 about doing FCC beta based on what I was reading on reddit, but they are no
 longer accepting new campers, so I decided to stick to the normal FCC.

### Day 67: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the tribute page. Started and almost finished my portfolio webpage!

**Thoughts**: I thought I understood CSS/Bootstrap when I was going through the
 FCC curriculum, but these projects have revealed some misunderstandings. Today I
 decided that my goal is to be employed one year after I started learning
 how to program (May 27, 2017) making the same pay as I do now.
 
 ### Day 68: August 3, 2017
 
 **Today's Progress**: Made minor changes to Portfolio webpage, made some solid progress on the Basic Javascript section.
 
 **Thoughts**: I can't wait until I get past the syntax and start doing cool stuff with Javascript. I also still need to add a nav bar to my portfolio page and then copy/paste my code into codepen. It's crazy that I've only been coding for a little less than 10 weeks. It feels like that was so long ago!
 
 ### Day 69: August 4, 2017
 
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Javascript section, 70% done with Basic Algorithm Scripting section, organized a CodeClub meetup for Sunday, August 6th.
 
 **Thoughts**: Wondering when I should start writing blogposts, learning DS&A, contributing to open source projects, etc. Even though I still have 9 months to achieve my goal, I still feel like I am far from being employable.
 
 ### Day 70: August 5, 2017
 
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting Section and JSON APIs and AJAX Section. Messed around with Vim and Atom.
 
 **Thoughts**: After reading about different text editors/IDEs, I figured I'd give Vim a try. I really like the keyboard shortcuts, but at this point I think I need to focus on my code rather than figuring out how to use Vim. After messing around with Atom, I think I am going to make the switch from Intellij Idea. I like that Atom is open source and doesn't block certain packages unless you pay.

### Day 71: August 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed random quote generator and local weather web application.

**Thoughts**: Using javascript to make dynamic webpages is pretty neat. I think I should start a blog to document my journey of learning to code. I really want to get into the back-end already! I feel like I keep putting off actually utilizing bootstrap; I would like to make attractive webpages, but it seems time-consuming. The CodeClub meetup today was a bust. Note to self: give members more than 2 days notice for a meetup.

### Day 72: August 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed wikipedia viewer project.

**Thoughts**: Hit my first real snag in FCC. I was essentially trying to use ajax data before it was sent to me. After a lot of googling and getting nowhere I decided to try to return a function that did something with the ajax data. This forced the ajax request to finish before using the data. My webpages aren't pretty, but they fulfill the user stories. I plan on coming back and touching them up, though I'm not sure when I'm going to commit to really learning CSS!

### Day 73: August 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed 25% of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Section.

**Thoughts**: Decided to take a light day...wasn't feeling like doing the twitch project, so I skipped ahead to the Intermediate Algorithms. Asked a question on reddit whether or not I should worry about making my projects pretty at this stage, and the consensus seemed to be yes, I should be spending time growing my CSS competence and making my projects pretty. My problem is that I often feel accomplished when I fulfill the user stories and don't have any drive to go back and touch it up. I feel like I should be documenting my progress through a blog or something.

### Day 74: August 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went to oakland.js meetup and began Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I read on reddit that people recommended following along with Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp while doing FreeCodeCamp, so I am in the process of getting up to speed on Colt's program. I am glad I went to the oakland.js meetup this week, met some cool people and had some cool discussions about javascript and web development. I saw a porfolio of someone who recently finished a bootcamp, and I realized how far away I am...but it's motivating! I only worry that I have a lack of focus given that I am working on CodeClub, FreeCodeCamp, and Colt Steele's bootcamp.

### Day 75: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went to CodeClub meetup, planned a meetup for 9/3, finished a couple intermediate algorithm problems, completed twitch web app

**Thoughts**: Didn't really socialize too much at the meetup, just put my head down and cranked out some algorithms. I'm hoping that people will RSVP for my 9/3 meetup given that there is plenty of time for people to see it and plan for it. The asynchronous nature of javascript continues to trip me up. I originally wanted to obtain all the information from twitch synchronously and then send it to the DOM. I realized it was better to build the skeleton into the DOM, so that all the API calls could be asynchronous without changing the DOM unpredictably depending on which calls finished first. Wondering if I should crunch away at freecodecamp or shift over to Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp.

### Day 76: August 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished a couple more intermediate algorithm problems, some advanced algorithm problems, and watched the HTML and some CSS sections of Colt Steele's The Web Developer's Bootcamp (WDB)

**Thoughts**: Holding off on some of the intermediate algorithm problems because a fellow FCC camper wanted to do pair programming on some of them. I agree with many people in that WDB is a good supplement for FCC. I find that in FCC I just hack away until I fulfill the user stories not knowing if my code is being done the "right" way. WDB walks through code explaining why things should be done a certain way. Also, WDB uses a real text editor (Sublime) rather than codepen, so it is less hand-holding in that regard. I have also found that the difficult part of completing the algorithms is not just completing them, but completing them in a non-brute force, elegant manner. I try to make my solutions somewhere in between brute force and optimized, so that I am learning but not wasting too much time.

### Day 77: August 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started blogging about my first day coding and my journey through cs50. Continued the advanced algorithm scripting in FCC.

**Thoughts**: There has been a voice in my head telling me I should capture my journey through text moreso than just with this log, and today I finally turned that voice into action. I wrote down why I started to learn to code and why I made some of the decisions that I did. Quincy Larson said that there are a lot of blogs on the "Hello World" level and a lot on the advanced level, but not a lot in between. Hopefully my blog (when I do publish it) will be useful to someone who is teaching him/herself to code. For now I will keep my "blog" private, but I did post part of it to reddit today. "No repeats please" advanced algorithm problem was difficult. It was especially frustrating when my code was correct, but I couldn't get the test to pass! I realized that it doesn't like global variables and quickly resolved the issue. Today was my first time using recursion on FCC. I tried to figure out the math solution for a good hour or two and then gave up. I only have 3 advanced algorithm problems left!

### Day 78: August 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started reading "You don't know javascipt" up to "Scope & Closures Chapter 2: Lexical Scope", made solid progress on the tic tac toe project in FCC.

**Thoughts**: I didn't have a ton of time today because I was travelling all day, but I still made some solid progress! The tic-tac-toe game is way more lines of code than it needs to be, but it is only a few finishing touches away from fulfilling the user stories. You Don't Know Javscipt seems to be the phrase that applies to you after you're done reading the book. It is dense. I don't think I am far enough along to really grasp the material, but it is good to get exposed to it. When closures, promises, callbacks come up later, it won't be the first time that I have heard of them. The podcasts I listen to talk about this stuff too, so it's nice to learn about it a little, so that I can understand more of the podcasts I listen to. I think I am getting to the point where I have too much going on: FCC, CodeClub, YDKJS, CSWDB, blogging. That's a lot. I'm going to have to get more focused. I also decided today that I want to live code on twitch at some point.

### Day 79: August 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished some more intermediate algorthm scripting problems

**Thoughts**: I only have 5 intermediate and 3 advanced algorithm scripting problems left! If you go by the number of hours that FCC says it is supposed to take to do each section, then I am 62% done with the front end certification. Still a long way to go, but I can't believe I have come this far in really only 16 days.

### Day 80: August 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished a couple more intermediate algorithm scripting problems

**Thoughts**: Just read about the p1xt guide which recommends against doing the FCC front end program...

### Day 81: August 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the intermediate algorithm scripting section

**Thoughts**: today is my birthday, yay

### Day 82: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 more advanced algorithm scripting problems. Only one more to go!

**Thoughts**: And the last one is a doozy. I finally need to learn this and closures. I tried reading those sections of YDKJS and I'm still confused. I'll try again tomorrow!

### Day 83: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read some more YDKJS while on the plane travelling back home and finished the advanced algorithm scipting section!

**Thoughts**: Now the only thing standing between me and the Front End Certification is the Advanced Front End Development Project Section! Then I'll have to decide which certification I'll aim for next...I was going to dive into React, but now I'm not sure if I should after all the licensing issues...

### Day 84: August 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fulfilled user stories for tic tac toe and javascipt calculator projects in FCC

**Thoughts**: Thinking I should catch up on WDB and try to find out how to use the material I am learning from YDKJS

### Day 85: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fulfilled user stories for pomodoro clock project

**Thoughts**: Only one more project left for the front end certification!

### Day 86: August 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fulfilled user stories for the simon project

**Thoughts**: Now I just need to find out a way to submit my projects to FCC...Looks like I need to make a separate repo for each project if I want to use GitHub Pages...

### Day 87: August 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made GitHub repos for each of my FCC projects and made GitHub Pages for each of those, so that I could submit them to FCC.....and get my front end certification! Started looking into how I should learn React. I also watched some WDB, I'm currently on lecture 60.

**Thoughts**: Excited to finally begin learning React! Though again that licensing issue makes me worry a bit...not enough to choose a different framework though.

### Day 88: August 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began Facebook's react.js tutorial and attended javascript meetup

**Thoughts**: I hope that I can learn react by doing Facebook's tutorial and reading through the documentation. It doesn't seem like there are many good free courses. I think I would like to learn React then Node and then start contributing to open source software.

### Day 90: August 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through facebook react tutorial, started egghead.io react tutorial

**Thoughts**: Learning react has been much more difficult than HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Javascript/jQuery. There isn't as much free material on the web, and you need to understand more advanced javascript concepts. "this" is still difficult for me to understand. Hopefully I can find a supplement to YDKJS.

### Day 91: August 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read YDKJS sections on `this`, hacked on YDKJS `this` code, and tried to use that to understand what all the `this`s are doing in the facebook react code.

**Thoughts**: I am making progress on understanding the facebook react tutorial, but it is taking time. I am hoping that I can use YDKJS to fully understand the facebook react tutorial code.

### Day 92: August 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went to Oakland FCC meetup, but spent the whole time trying to fix my ubuntu slow boot issue. Continued learning about `this` and classes. I had an 'aha' moment when I realized the structures inside of the React Components were methods and not functions...all of a sudden `this` made a lot more sense in the React tutorial code. This made me realize that I should read YDKJS cover to cover before learning React. I also learned today that it is possible that my SSD is dying...to buy a new laptop or get a new SSD and learn how to install it...

### Day 93: August 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning `this` in YDKJS. Set up the babel transpiler, so that I can code along with YDKJS in ES6, and see the results on the browser.

**Thoughts**: Learning `this` with YDKJS is taking a long time, but I know that going through YDKJS and following along with the example code will better prepare me in the long run. I am getting antsy...I want to get going on those FCC react apps.

### Day 94: August 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Moved on to the Objects section of YDKJS. Next step is learning classes.

**Thoughts**: Progress seems slow, but I am focused which is a good thing.

### Day 96: August 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended CodeClub meetup and learned how the CodeClub website is set up

**Thoughts**: It would be cool to use react on the CodeClub website, but I'm not sure if it's necessary or when it would be most useful.

### Day 97: September 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read about classes in ydkjs

**Thoughts**: I need to pick up the pace..I feel like I have been wasting time the last week or so. I'm going to hit it hard tomorrow.

### Day 98: September 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading about `class`es and `prototype` in ydkjs until I got bored/tired and watched a couple CSWDB videos (currently on lecture 65).

**Thoughts**: I am hosting a CodeClub meetup tomorrow, and I think I am going to take another stab at React tomorrow.

### Day 99: September 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Hosted CodeClub meetup, added "how to contribute" page to CodeClub dev repo, and started/finished my first react app

**Thoughts**: I got a lot done today. I'm happy that I finally contributed to the CodeClub website; hopefully I can get more into it and make more meaningful contributions. It seems like it's really good experience learning how to use Git on a team. Even though I don't fully understand all of the javascript fundamentals, I am glad that I decided to dive in and make my first react app. I think I will plan to finish the freecodecamp react projects, and then later read back through ydkjs. That way I will have some context, and the content will (hopefully) stick in my head a little better. Tomorrow I am planning on make monthly goals to make sure that I am on track with my progress.

### Day 100: September 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some solid progress on the next react app on the FCC data visualization track. Also, made a monthly goals onenote page, so that I ensure that I have short term goals that help me meet my long term goal.

**Thoughts**: I am really glad that I decided to make the short term goals onenote because it is really easy to fall behind without knowing it when you don't have milestones along the way.

### Day 101: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Watched some more CSWDB videos, up to lecture 72 now. Completed the FCC leaderboard project, learned how to build react in an existing web app, used react and the meetup API to display info about the next meetup on the index page of codeclub.social

**Thoughts**: I am glad that I am watching the CSWDB videos. I am now up to the Bootstrap section which made me realize that I have not used Bootstrap in any of my projects thus far. I should probably go back through my projects, and give the CSS some attention, apply the Bootstrap knowledge that I obtained from CSWDB. It was a very productive night, but I should try to go to bed before midnight going forward...preferrably before 10:30PM...This was one of those days where I felt very accomplished by the end. I enjoy working on codeclub.social; however, I also really like the structure of FCC.

### Day 102: September 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went to oakland.js meetup, worked on trying to get the meetup RSVP button to work on codeclub.social

**Thoughts**: I don't know why I can't get the POST request to work with the meetup API, but hopefully I will get some help at the codeclub meetup tomorrow.

### Day 103: September 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended CodeClub meetup and continued working on meetup API for CodeClub

**Thoughts**: Didn't make it out to the sudoroom for javascript night, hoping to make it next week. Still not sure why this oauth2 post request isn't working with the meetup api. I'll try again tomorrow...

### Day 104: September 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally got the meetup rsvp button to work on codeclub.social! I merged with dev. Now when the user goes to the index page, he/she can get information about the next meetup, rsvp to the next meetup, and then there will be a message saying that the user did in fact rsvp.

**Thoughts**: The issue with the authentication had something to do with the html form I was using as a button to log in. As soon as I made it an anchor tag, it worked right away. I did something with cookies for the first time which was pretty neat. Overall, I feel pretty accomplished. Perhaps, I should add some more functionality and make it pretty, so that I make it something I am proud of.

### Day 105: September 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up the react meetup api code a bit, made it into a bootstrap card on Brian's suggestion

**Thoughts**: I think I am going to make a card for each of the next 3 meetups. This will make the log ins a little more complicated but it shouldn't be too bad. I am also planning on working on the FCC react recipe box tomorrow. It would probably be a good idea to make a medium post twice a month or so. Maybe I will start that tomorrow as well.

### Day 108: September 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made bootstrap cards for the next 3 meeetups. Working on getting the RSVP buttons functional.

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately I was unable to code the last 2 days due to personal circumstances, but I am back at it. As soon as I get the 3 RSVP buttons to work, I will work on the next FCC React project. As for the medium post, I may want to make my own blog site...

### Day 109: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the RSVP buttons

**Thoughts**: Finally got the RSVP buttons to work! I haven't pushed to dev yet, but the user can now see the next 3 meetups and RSVP to any/all of them after logging in to meetup. Ready to move on to the next React project in FCC! Though I think I should go over the FB tutorial again...I feel like I am under-utilizing props.

### Day 110: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished RSVP buttons, cleaned up the code, pushed to dev, and attended CodeClub meetup

**Thoughts**: Ready to get back to the FCC React projects and try to code the React way rather than the hacky way. Recently I have not been coding as much, and I need to kick it back into high gear if I want to meet my goal.

### Day 111: September 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started recipe box project, began the design using bootstrap

**Thoughts**: Ready to start using bootstrap and making my websites cleaner. This seems like a good project to get more familiar with the React lifecycle.

### Day 112: September 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing work on recipe box

**Thoughts**: Didn't have much time to work on this today, but I'm ready to get right back into it tomorrow

### Day 113: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished recipe box, started the game of life

**Thoughts**: Seems like this project will take a little bit longer than the other ones. I really want to move to the back end contribute some more to CodeClub! Also, I want to find a better way to meet other web developers near my level.

### Day 114: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the game of life working

**Thoughts**: I really want the chart to work out. That would be a cool feature, but I don't think the chart js react library was made to be updated every second...it's doing some weird things to my timer. Thinking about forgetting about the chart and moving on.

### Day 115: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I figured out the issue and got the chart to work. There are still some glitches, but form reading the github issues, it seems like there are some bugs in the library.

**Thoughts**: I am ready to move on past this project, but I am not quite done yet. Turns out the problem had to do with me running this.setState() more than once in componentDidUpdate(), so basically I had an open control loop that was opening an exponential amount of setState lifecycles. I was causing an exponentially infinite loop, so that's pretty neat.

### Day 116: September 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fulfilled all the user stories for the game of life FCC project plus I added a dynamic line chart that plots the generations.

**Thoughts**: I am ready to move on to the back end! What an exciting day in Austin's journey of learning to code. I plan to start the back end section of FCC, though I'm sure I will need to supplement with something else outside of FCC.

### Day 117: September 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended CodeClub meetup. Started the back end section in FCC! Completed the how-to-npm tutorial.

**Thoughts**: Next step is to start a Node.js server! Can't wait!

### Day 119: September 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed 5/13 exercises of learnyounode, messed around with Vim for small text files

**Thoughts**: Node reminds me of some of the stuff I did with C and Python in cs50

### Day 120: September 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed all exercises of learnyounode

**Thoughts**: Servers are pretty neat. Looking forward to using Express to build web apps. Also, I think I could benefit from taking the extra effort to learn what goes on behind the hood during HTTP requests and basic server operation. I am on track to complete my September goals by the end of the month.

### Day 121: September 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed all expressworks exercises

**Thoughts**: Not sure if I should do the Git exercises or not given that I have used Git quite extensively with CodeClub

### Day 122: September 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended Uber meetup, started learnyoumongo

**Thoughts**: I am glad I went to the Uber meetup. I learned a lot about the culture and values of a company like Uber. I realized that there aren't as many people that show up to that kind of event as I originally thought which means the employee to attendee ratio is quite high. If I were farther along in my development, I would definitely go to events like this more often; however, at this stage I think I need to focus more on developing my skills, such as mongodb ;) I also listened to an interesting VC podcast; seems like a common mistake among founders is that they focus on the code too much and on the sales too little.

### Day 123: September 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on learnyoumongo exercises. Completed 5/9 exercises.

**Thoughts**: I think I am in another working lull. I need to focus and put in the hours. Purchased Colt Steele's new Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp. Looks like it has a lot of good material in it. Looking forward to starting it.

### Day 124: September 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed learnyoumongo

**Thoughts**: Completed my goals for September! Next steps are to start the FCC API projects, then make CodeClub contributions, then complete final project for cs50. I have a long month ahead of me...

### Day 126: September 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the first FCC API Project, did some writing on my first meetup, linux, the Odin Project, FCC; still only stored in OneNote. I'll have to put my blog posts up online soon.

**Thoughts**: I didn't know it was so easy to run a local server with node. Makes me laugh thinking back to the first time I downloaded and ran Atom, and I was looking for a package that would start a live server for me. I remember thinking it was magic back then.

### Day 127: October 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: All kinds of progress today. Finished first 3 API projects, and then started having some fun on the 4th. Made a node app that gets picture id from imgur.com/random and then scrapes the page to get the title of that photo and adds it to a mongo database.

**Thoughts**: I made a lot of progress and had a lot of fun. There were definitely frustrating parts. I had issues doing http requests in a loop. I couldn't get mongodb to work for the longest time because of not having the right versions and then having the wrong password. But I wrote a script that gets information and stores it in a database without using an API. I should probably change my code to use the Imgur API once I have the image id, but I'd hate to delete my beautifully hacky web scraping.

### Day 128: October 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on making database of imgur images, focused on trying to get the random image info via imgur api.

**Thoughts**: Today is one of the few times where I am going to bed before solving the problem I'm working on, but I figure it is worth it to go to bed at a (semi) reasonable time. Trying to figure out how to do two http requests in series with async.queue

### Day 129: October 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out the problem from yesterday. Attended two meetups in sf: Rithm School JS The Tricky Parts and Beer.js

**Thoughts**: Regarding my problem from yesterday, I ended up using async.series with async.queue and also corrected my http.request syntax. The meetups were super useful. The Rithm School class was very useful in helping me learn this, binding, closure, etc. It made me realize I don't know as much as I thought I did. I have a lot to learn in order to get past javascript phone screens. Beer.js was great because there were a good number of developers that were actually professionals in the field that recently moved to the area. It was surprisingly easy to talk to them about web development and I could give them advice about the bay area. Those hours and hours of podcasts I listen to every day are starting to pay off. One guy even connect with me on LinkedIn and offered help if I needed it. Overall, my opinion on sf meetups are much higher than east bay meetups.

### Day 130: October 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added tags to my random Imgur images database to be used later for a search feature. Made an API that takes a number, n, as input and spits out an array of images from my db with length n.

**Thoughts**: Now all I need to do is keeping building my db and then figure out how to use my API to send those arrays of images to the browser and spit them out on a webpage! My end goal is for a user to be able to pick how many random images they want displayed on the webpage and then be able to search for images either within that array or search the whole database. I am really enjoying back end work and I am looking forward to making a full stack web app.

### Day 131: October 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed my first real full stack web app! It pulls in imgur random image data from a database I created with mongodb, and then displays the images to the browser. Also, watched some CSWDB while I cooked; I am up to lecture 108. Also my db is now over 1100 objects!

**Thoughts**: I enjoy full stack web development. As it stands right now, it takes too long to get all x images from imgur and display them. I'll have to look up different ways to do it more quickly. I also plan to give the user the option of how many images they want to display at a time and then maybe even make it searchable. Tomorrow I may take a break and work on CodeClub.

### Day 132: October 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added forum reply feature to CodeClub!

**Thoughts**: I am getting pretty comfortable (relatively speaking) with full stack development. I am surprised it didn't take me that long to read through the codebase and start making contributions on the forum.

### Day 133: October 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Improved the forum reply feature. The rich text editor is now hidden until the user clicks "Reply", the user's username is now associated with the comment, and the date created is also displayed with the comment. The date is displayed in the user's timezone. Started watching the new Colt Steele Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp, learned CSS animations.

**Thoughts**: They say that the last 10% takes 90% of the time and I believe it. Getting the timezone to display correctly was a trip. I learned that the ejs files were being rendered on the server side, so when heroku renders the ejs file and sends the html file to the browser, the date object was being parsed assuming UTC timezone, not the user's timezone. To get around this, I made a js file that fetches the date object of each comment, parses it, and manipulates the DOM.

### Day 134: October 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the upvote/downvote feature.

**Thoughts**: I had originally planned to spend today revisiting my long term plan / monthly goals. That didn't happen. I kept chugging away at CodeClub forum. Who knew that upvoting and downvoting could be so involved? I got it up and running and I was happy. I could click the upvote button and the upvote number would increment by one and then I click the downvote button and it would increment one. Then I realized the problem...I could upvote/downvote as many times as I wanted and it would just keep going. The server/database did not know that I had already upvoted, so it could not stop m from upvoting as many times as I wanted. I knew I had to add this to the db somehow. I had to decide if I wanted to add this to the user collection or the msgboard collection. Ultimately I decided to add this feature to the msgboard feature as I didn't want to mess up the user collection. I'm glad that I left the user collection alone, I think it makes sense to not clog up that db with info not added on sign up. Although if you wanted to do some user data analytics, it would be a lot easier if that data was on the user collection...oh well. The other thing I had to decide was how to store the data. Ultimately I chose to store it as an object. Each post object has a key "voters" which has a value of an object that has key-value pairs "username":"1 || -1" where username is the voter's username and 1 is associated with an upvote, -1 a downvote. This made it easy to check if a username is in the database and use the data. My first thought was to use an array of voters, but I realized that order didn't matter, so there was no point in using an array. Anyways, I really do need to revisit my long term plan and make sure that I'm on track. Maybe I will do that tomorrow. Also, not sure what to work on next for CodeClub.

### Day 135: October 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Thought about my future goals/plan, committed blogposts to github, implemented 2 features to image-search: user can specify how many images they want to see, user can search the db specifying the number of images they want to receive and will get back images that have a title that includes their search or have a tag that is included in the search term.

**Thoughts**: In typing out the new features for image-search, I noticed that the tags search wasn't great. I had it such that the search term had to === the tag which is not ideal. If a tag is "awesome" then it should be a match if the search term is "awesome sauce". In looking at my future goals/plan, I realized that I have a lot that I need to accomplish in a small amount of time, especially given that I will be gone 2 weeks in November. It was a good motivator. I am so glad that I made monthly goals to help me reach my longterm goal. I would honestly be lost without it. I also realized that I need to be writing more. I have been writing a bit about my journey, but it seems like I should be writing moreso about what I'm learning and less about my journey.

### Day 136: October 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished setup for last FCC API project, file-size

**Thoughts**: I read a reddit post asking about how to know when you're ready to start applying to jobs, and there was a guide posted that had a very long list of things you should know. It made me think about how there are so many things that everyone says you should do/know in order to be a good web developer. I think if you focus too much about trying to understand each and every one of the topics, then you'll be spread too thin or spend too much time trying to learn all these different areas. I was debating about whether or not I should do this last project. It definitely isn't the sexiest project, but I figured I should have some exposure to working with user-submitted files.

### Day 137: October 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the last FCC API project, file-size

**Thoughts**: Just read a reddit post about someone who got a job as a self-taught developer. He/She finished 3 major projects: 2 of them full stack web apps and 1 android, used unit testing, agile development, etc. It made me a little worried about my status/plan. I'm currently worried about not having great portfolio projects, not having started unit testing, and not using debugging tools much. Sometimes I wonder if I should learn some mobile development or maybe Python to help me stand out. I could also benefit from reading up on how version control should be structured with a large app. It's hard to determine what you should learn and what you should not bother with.

### Day 138: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Googelp, a side-by-side google maps/yelp comparison web app. Started troubleshooting CodeClub intermittent app timeout when submitting signup form.

**Thoughts**: Pretty excited about this Googelp project. I googled it and didn't find anything, so it seems at least a little original. This CodeClub bug is intriguing. First time I have encountered a bug that seems to be truly intermittent. Worked for some of us and not others at some times but not others.

### Day 139: October 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Found and fixed the CodeClub signup bug. Added Google Maps map to Googelp app.

**Thoughts**: As we all know, programs don't really ever truly do certain things "intermittently" there is a reason for everything that the program does, and it seems as though this reason is that `passport.authenticate('local-signup)` has issues when the username or email is already in the database. I did a simple db query to check if the username/email is already in the db or not. As for Googelp, at first I was trying to use a google maps react library, but then I realized it was clunky and I had no idea what it was doing, so then I just read the Google Maps API docs a little more, read a quick tutorial, and then did it on my own in React. Aside from knowing to use loadjs, it was all pretty straightforward. I am glad I made this decision as it will be much easier to edit the app and implement new features. It's never a good idea to just use a library without having any idea how it works or what it does. I'm trying to get away from the hacky way of doing things. Speaking of which, I just purchased "Clean Code" and CTCI on Amazon. Everyone recommends those books, so I figured it was only a matter of time. Now I just need to worry about when to find time to read them...

### Day 140: October 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended Oakland Nodeschool meetup, went hard on Googelp project.

**Thoughts**: Nodeschool is one of my favorite meetups I have attended thus far. The focus is on mentor/mentee interaction, so there is a focus on learning, but there is also the social interaction side as well. It is 4 hours, so even if you work hard for 3 hours, there is still 1 hour to socialize and meet people. Plus there is free pizza and refreshments! Bummer that it's only once a month. I will definitely try to go to as many as I can. Who knows, maybe I will go as a mentor one of these days. As for Googelp, I went real hard today. Was up until 3:30 AM. Ran into a couple issues. 1) Google Maps API documentation is abundant in terms of guides and tutorials but lacking in terms of depth, so it's hard to know what is actually going on underneath the hood. 2) CORS CORS CORS. I had all kinds of issues trying to get Yelp API data from client-side requests. Makes sense given that you shouldn't be sending auth tokens client-side. Switching this over to the backend worked like a charm. 3) Yelp business match API is in beta and doesn't work (My original goal was to search in a search box for say "coffee shops" then you would get 20 results from google maps and then for each of those results I would get Yelp API data. Yelp business match API would have been perfect, but it works horribly). Overall, it took a lot of time and effort, but this was one of those times where I was glad that I stayed up and kept working until I finished, because I was so happy that I almost couldn't sleep even though it was 3:30 AM! As for tomorrow, let's see if I actually stick to my plan of writing a blogpost every other Sunday...

### Day 141: October 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up Googelp, wrote a blogpost.

**Thoughts**: Worked on minor bug fixes to improve the UX, but there's still a long way to go. I'm sure this is one of those things where they say 20% of the work takes 80% of the time. Responsiveness, basic UI/UX, styling, all those things will take time, but I think I am going to actually finish this project to full completion, rather than stopping when it works and moving on. I want to push it to Github and make a heroku app, but I feel like I shouldn't given that there are secret API keys. Perhaps tomorrow I will work on finding a way to do that. I'm surprised that I actually wrote a blogpost. I read through my 100 days of code log and it seemed like I talked about starting a blog maybe 10 times. I may want to do it weekly instead of every other week...I'll have to think it over. I go back and forth but right now I'm thinking that reaching my long term goal will be very difficult, and I'm not sure that I can do it.

### Day 142: October 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Hosted googelp on heroku.

**Thoughts**: Learned how to host a full stack React app to heroku. I had previously thought that `npm run build` was only used for real production web apps, but I just now realized that it needs to be used if you are hosting your web apps. I also realized that webpack is only used for dev purposes. I really should the webpack documentation. I have been spoiled (or maybe punished) for using create-react-app so freely and trustingly.

### Day 143: October 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended Uber Web meetup, made googelp environment such that it is easy to deploy on heroku and easy to develop. Determined that Google Place Details API won't allow me to find out the number of reviews that each search result has. It only sends up to 5 reviews. I need to decide how much time and effort I want to put into this project. A thought popped into my head to make the app a full page google map and then have google / yelp search result layers pop up over the map and perhaps allow the user to draw their search bounds. That all could take 2-4 weeks to implement which is a lot considering my timeline. Also, decided that it made sense to learn DS&A before contributing to open source.

### Day 144: October 18. 2017

**Today's Progress**: Changed google places search results from a google maps method, getPlaces(), to a fetch request done on the backend, so now the user does not have to hit enter twice and improved predictability.

**Thoughts**: The downside of doing it this way is that it is now much slower. There are 2 requests to the server to make 2 more requests to the yelp and google APIs, and these are done in series. I am sure there is a faster way to do it, but I'm not sure how to do it. I wonder if you can make the requests at the same time and only move on when you receive data from both fetch requests? Next steps are to use latitude and longitude to determine which results show up for both google and yelp, just google, and just yelp. I can then use this information to have 3 different marker colors and have infowindows that display the google/yelp rating. Then farther down the line, I could have the map be the full page and the search results could be layered above the map, and the user could draw the search area. Maybe too ambitious, we'll see.

### Day 146: October 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on googelp project. Now tracking which search results show up on both google and yelp, made a separate icon on google maps for such cases. Added location search, so that the user can search a different location other than the current map area.

**Thoughts**: Didn't code yesterday because I hung out with some friends all evening after work. The algorithm to determine if a google search result matches a yelp result is actually more difficult than I thought it would be. I originally thought I could do it just by coordinates, but google and yelp can be up to 100 meters off for the same place which, in the city, could easily be a different place entirely. The search result name also differs. Ultimately, I had to make an algorithm that used name, address, and coordinates, to minimize false negatives and false positives. Oh, I also toured Dropbox today, and it was amazing. Open bar, free dinner, free snacks, free coffee shop, it was insane.

### Day 147: October 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Changed background color to be more appealing, added a loader onSubmit, removed focus from inputs onSubmit, so that the mobile keyboard hides onSubmit. Search result div heights are now set at the height of the tallest item.

**Thoughts**: This project is really coming together. I am pretty excited to share this with friends and family as well as ultimately posting it to Reddit. I'm a little scared to share my code as it is quite hacky, but I'm sure I would get a lot of great feedback from other redditors. I keep thinking about how awesome the Dropbox tour was, and now I want to jump into preparing for interviews and start applying! But I shouldn't. I still have a long way to go.

### Day 148: October 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Changed name to yeggle, changed the favicon and maps icon that represents google and yelp search result. Changed search results back so that the number of google/yelp results aren't limited to the minimum length. Added API request to google that will allow the location to not exactly match address (user can type in "berkeley, ca" instead of "Berkeley, CA, United States"). Started on adding sort/filter functionality.

**Thoughts**: I am getting a little sick of this project. I tackled all the low hanging fruit by the morning, so I had to start fixing some of the issues that I was putting off. Namely the additional API request for location and the sort/filter feature. I was debating whether I needed to added the sort/filter feature, but I realized that if I plan to show this to people and have real users, then it will need to have the sort/filter feature. But wow is it more of a pain than I originally thought. If I am sorting by rating, and then I decide to uncheck the "$$" box, then that means I need to add all the results with "$$". Well that shouldn't be much of a problem except now I have to sort again. Does that mean that I have to resort everything? Yes, yes it does. I am ready to get this project done, show it off, and move on. Also, not sure if I want to build something else or move on to YDKJS.

### Day 149: October 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished sort/filter feature, added transparent div to freeze page during loading.

**Thoughts**: I was determined to finish and stayed up until 2:30 AM to do so. I had plans to share on reddit and get hit with loads of criticism, but to no avail. I only received one comment and it was someone complaining that I was explaining the UI. I'm a little disappointed, but 1) Reddit can be unpredictable, and 2) Honestly, from their standards it probably wasn't that difficult or novel of an idea. Haven't quite decided what I am going to do next.

### Day 150: October 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read the first 59 pages of Clean Code (intro, variable naming, functions, comments), took some notes.

**Thoughts**: Wow, can't believe I'm already at 88 days. It feels like it was so long ago when I started this challenge and was just learning git and hadn't even started learning javascript! I recently read an article on reddit (https://codeburst.io/getting-into-software-development-ca6b8d4ce49e) that basically recommended all the things that I have seen people recommend and talk about, but I had just been putting off. Namely, writing clean code and writing tests. Before I contribute to open source I definitely should learn clean code, writing tests, and complex javascript.

### Day 151: October 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Up to page 120 of Clean Code.

**Thoughts**: I understand the importance of this book, but wow is it dry and boring. I keep having to keep myself from falling asleep. I wish it was written in javascript. I know there was a github repo of clean code for javascript. I'll have to take a look through that once I'm done with clean code. On one hand I wish I would have read this earlier, but on the other hand, it is nice that I have some coding under my belt, so that the learnings are more applicable.

### Day 152: October 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went to CodeClub meetup, fixed a few small bugs in yeggle.

**Thoughts**: Yeggle received a lot of complements at the CodeClub meetup which was nice considering I received no comments when I posted it to reddit. One of the bugs I was experiencing was in regards to the yeggle button. When the yeggle button is clicked, and you click on one of the markers, only one info window pops up and it is always on the last marker of the list. This bug related to the way that I was making the markers when the yeggle button was clicked. It was a for loop that was reassigning values to bothPlacesMarker and adding an event listener. It turns out that every event listener was tied to bothPlacesMarker, not the value of bothPlacesMarker at the time of creation. I circumvented this issue by creating a separate function that added an event listener and took bothPlacesMarker as an argument.

### Day 153: October 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: "Finished" Clean Code by Robert C. Martin. Submitted final project for cs50.

**Thoughts**: There were a couple chapters of material that was either only relevant to Java or it was material that I had simply never heard of and never used, so I skipped those sections. I am very glad that I bought the book and read through it. I had no idea that functions were supposed to be short, and variable names were supposed to be long and descriptive. I learned a little bit about testing. Before, I was wondering why ES6 was needed. I thought I could code whatever I wanted without it, but I can see how clean code would be easier to write with ES6+. I will say that Clean Code was very dry. There were many times when I would start reading and instantly felt sleepy. But I knew it was important, and now I am glad that I have it as a reference. I will try to implement clean code in my future work. I was going to submit my yeggle project for cs50, but then I realized it would be difficult to upload my code to cloud9, so I decided to upload my tic tac toe. Funny how I was waiting all this time because I wanted my final project to be good, and it turns out that I just submitted tic tac toe.

### Day 154: October 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started youtube machine learning with python tutorial.

**Thoughts**: I'm not sure if I should be putting my time/effort elsewhere, but it seems like a project with ML would be a cool zinger on a portfolio

### Day 155: October 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued machine learning with python tutorial. Decided that my python ML web app is going to be a stock game where the user "plays" against AI in picking stocks to buy/sell. Also, applied for Udacity nanodegree scholarship.

**Thoughts**: I also looked up how many projects one should have on a portfolio. The consensus seemed to be 2-4. My plan right now is to have 4: codeclub, yeggle, python ML app, web animation + payment API + passport. I hope to have them done by end of November, early December but we'll see. The good thing is that I will be at home on vacation for 10 days, so I should be able to spend a lot of time coding then. The application for nanodegree full scholarship seemed to me like a no-brainer. It would be nice to have someone review my code and help with portfolio, github profile, etc. I guess I will know by December 7th...seems so long away.

### Day 156: October 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Configured React + D3 + Python Flask app.

**Thoughts**: Excitied to actually start working on this web app. Can't wait to work on a project with ML!

### Day 173: November 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I'm back from my two week vacation to Japan and Thailand! Well, kinda. I went to the Real World React meetup and met a bunch of cool people!

**Thoughts**: I really need to jump back into coding. I'm hoping I can finish my python ml app within a week, but that might be a bit ambitious, especially if I attend a bunch of meetups.

### Day 174: November 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Watched part of the D3 section of The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp

**Thoughts**: Had grand plans to make a bunch of progress on my stock game ML app, but I was sick all day :(

### Day 175: November 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the D3 section of The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp. Worked on the stock game app: fetched data from quandl and started trying to get D3 working with react. Also watched more videos from Coursera's "Learning how to learn".

**Thoughts**: Glad I got back into coding today, but I definitely need to put in more work tomorrow.

### Day 176: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on stocks game web app. Finally got random stock graph animation to work.

**Thoughts**: I was getting a little discouraged trying to get d3 to work with react. I'm glad I stuck with it, and I'm happy to finally get it to work.

### Day 177: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on stocks game web app. Added start button to initiate animation.

**Thoughts**: Didn't get a whole lot done today. This is the first time since I started programming where I have been having motivational issues. I really can't afford to hit a lull especially given that I just came off a 2 week vacation where I didn't code at all.

### Day 179: November 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on stocks game web app. Changed start button functionality such that the plotting immediately stops when the start button is clicked, added buy/sell functionality on up/down arrow key press, user is notified at the end whether or not they "beat the market". 

**Thoughts**: Yay it's day 100. I'm going to keep adding to this log probably until I get a job. Now I'm wondering if I should go back and re-number to set day 0 as the day I started to program. Hmmm that would be tedious but I like the idea...It was nice to have a full day to work on the stocks web app. I am pretty close to being ready to start adding the ML component.

### Day 180: November 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on stocks game web app. Made it responsive, changed background color, removed scatter plot for all points except those that are bought/sold. Commented on some reddit posts recommending FCC and CS50. Changed the log.md numbering to reflect the number of days since I started to program.

**Thoughts**: Happy Thanksgiving! It wasn't the most productive day, but it was a holiday after all. I read a reddit comment that convinced me that I really need to learn/use a relational database. It really doesn't make sense to use a non-relational db like MongoDB. I think I've done just about all I can do with my stocks game app without getting into the ML. I'm hoping I can finish by the end of the weekend and get a start on my next project.

### Day 181: November 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on StockIT. Developed linear regression model that predicts stock value ~30 days in the future.

**Thoughts**: It took me a very long time to get my sklearn linear regression model to work and then output the data in a usable format, but at this moment it works and spits out the data in a format that is usable by the front end. I got hung up on the preprocessing for a solid hour or two. Turns out I was applying two different preprocessing methods to the training data and the prediction data which was causing very poor predictions. Ultimately, I applied the preprocessing to training + prediction data and then split it up into two arrays after applying the preprocessing. I am looking forward to implementing the linear regression, finishing up the formatting, deploying to heroku, and moving on!

### Day 182: November 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on StockIT. Added leaderboard sidebar. Went to 2 berkeley meetups: Berkeley Javascript Dojo and Open Programming Session with Code Self Study.

**Thoughts**: There are some formatting issues I need to work out, and maybe I should consider adding buy and sell buttons. Other than that, the only changes I can think of have to do with preventing the intermittent python sklearn errors.

### Day 183: November 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on StockIT. Added responsive svg on window resize, made trending speed increase when user uses up all buys/sells, started trying to deploy to heroku, added "landing page", continued to improve formatting.

**Thoughts**: I'm so close to finishing this web app I can taste it. Though I'm sure there will be a lot of tweaking once I first view it on mobile. I could write a lot more, but it's late. Maybe I'll elaborate tomorrow.

### Day 184: November 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally deployed to heroku. Added buy and sell buttons because I realized that without them it is essentially unplayable on mobile.

**Thoughts**: Deploying a flask app with create-react-app was quite frankly a terrible experience. In the future, I should start from a boilerplate. Maybe use django instead of flask. The web app is really coming together. Still some needed formatting on mobile, but nothing major.

### Day 185: November 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tinkered with responsive svg formatting to improve experience on mobile.

**Thoughts**: It would be a lot easier if I could open up developer tools on mobile. I should look and see if there is an app for that...I'm sure there is, and it would save me a lot of dev time.

### Day 186: November 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the favicon to work, changed color to that of start button, attended oakland.js

**Thoughts**: Ended up making favicon from scratch in gimp, so that I could have higher resolution. I didn't know that favicons could be so intense...there are so many different types to account for apple/android icons. I only put the standard png's because I had to write out routings for each file due to difficulties with flask + react. Hoping to finish up this app tomorrow, it's been taking awhile.

### Day 187: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended Javascript Night at Sudo Room, added functionality to deactivate buy/sell buttons when user has 0 buys/sells, improved aesthetics of landing page, improved mobile UX when leaderboard mounts

**Thoughts**: I was hoping to finish today, but it looks like I'm going to need another day. Decided that my next app will be a full stack react/python/django/mysql app that scrapes job postings from indeed.com and ranks them based on user inputs: languages/frameworks and associated weights. I may use node/express/passport instead of python/django/passportEquivalent?? Anyways, it was encouraging that people were impressed with my apps at the oakland.js meetup

### Day 188: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some formatting, responsiveness issues. Leaderboard is now collapsible.

**Thoughts**: The collapsible leaderboard works on all desktop browsers and firefox mobile but not chrome mobile! It is quite frustrating. When I click the hamburger on chrome mobile, the leaderboard opens but it opens outside the viewing window, so then the user has to zoom out to see it. This is one of those few times when I can't google to find someone with a similar experience. Hopefully someone at nodeschool will be able to help me out tomorrow.

### Day 189: December 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went to nodeschool sf, fixed mobile chrome sizing issue! Tweaked mobile responsiveness. Finished!

**Thoughts**: So it wasn't working before the meetup, and I went to go ask someone for help, and then when I showed them, it worked! And then, get this, when I went home after the meetup, the damn thing stopped working. Well turns out I edited the build file but not the dev file. So when I made any change and then did an npm run build, then it overwrote my build file that had the change that fixed it. Finally, I can rest...until my next project.

### Day 190: December 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started my next project, jobSort(), a web app that scrapes job boards for postings and then sorts them based on the languages that the user knows and the weights they assigned.

**Thoughts**: The dataset html tag seemed convenient at first, but now I'm ready to throw it out the window. I want to let the user type the language/framework and then see a list of suggestions and pick one. However, when they press Enter to submit the form, the suggestions don't go away. Which is awful UX, and I'm trying to figure out a work-around. I might just get rid of the dataset tag and do my own implementation. Which would take a long time and be annoying, but what can ya do.

### Day 191: December 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Developed the skeleton of the front end. Users can input a job search term, enter languages/frameworks they know and also delete from the list, then users can assign weights to each language and send the data to the backend which, right now, just accepts the data and sends a dummy object back.

**Thoughts**: I had a productive evening, and I'm proud of what I accomplished today. My approach this project is to not let myself spin my wheels for too long. I want to get the app working before I worry about details. I realized that I will want to make some fancy web animations (partly because I know that the user will be waiting a bit). I also decided that I want to finish this project before I leave for vacation on December 15th. I will have to work a lot to meet that deadline, but that's a good thing because I haven't been moving as quickly, I think, as I was earlier in my journey.

### Day 192: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended Beer.js meetup in SF

**Thoughts**: Met some cool people for the first time, and some others for the 2nd/3rd time! Ultimately I'm glad I went, though these things tend to be hit or miss. One of the frontend guys there brought me back down to earth a little bit. I was feeling very accomplished and proud after having finished my first 2 real, unique full stack apps, but he wasn't too impressed and recommended that I start early, so that it can be an iterative process.

### Day 193: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added location search and implemented github api usage and jobsort on github jobs. Oh and I almost forgot...I purchased a Dell XPS 13 today!

**Thoughts**: I never felt too productive throughout the evening, but at the end of the day looking at my progress, I am proud of what I accomplished. December 15th is quickly approaching! I am going to have to kick it into high gear if I want to finish by then.

### Day 194: December 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended SFNode meetup, listened to redditors thoughts on StockIT and responded by using a slider bar to allow users to adjust game speed.

**Thoughts**: I am glad that I posted StockIT to reddit. I would not have thought that the game was too fast. When you play the game 100s of times, you get used to the speed because it helps speed up development. But it's hard to truly picture yourself as a first time user. The slider bar was the big one, but there were a couple other suggestions. I really do want to make all the users happy, but I also need to focus on my next (current) project.

### Day 195: December 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: github job results now print to the webpage, converted html job description to text and cut description to only 300 characters

**Thoughts**: I was home all day today and I did not get much work done. Part of it was because I am not sure where I want to take the project. Do I want to add monster.com and indeed.com and make it handle a lot of jobs or do I want to have it scrape HN: Who's Hiring and SO jobs and have it be smaller? I would think that it would be perhaps more challenging and get more recognition by other developers if it scraped HN and SO but perhaps it would be less useful. In reality, I need to just make a decision and go with it because I don't have time to twiddle my thumbs. I want to make an app that people will respect and appreciate, but in reality I probably should focus on making an app that builds my skills.

### Day 196: December 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: web app now also scrapes hacker news who's hiring and stack overflow jobs (had to learn promises!!) and then jobsort()'s them. Also, changed the yeggle PWA title, and fixed the StockIT PWA. 

**Thoughts**: I had an extremely productive day today, and I'm hoping to pick up where I left off tomorrow. Essentially worked from 5AM to 12:30AM with a couple hour long breaks in the middle. Tomorrow I will add a couple front end features, try to improve the speed (it's at 20s yeesh), clean up the data, and add passportjs/mysql. Oh, learning promises was awesome. I needed to find a way to run an array of asynchronous functions, and my usual async library wasn't doing it for me, so I ended up going with Promises. Though I'm really excited to finally understand promises (enough to use them) I really need to look into async/await. It looks really helpful. At this rate, I'll definitely finish this before I go home for the holiday.

### Day 197: December 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added tags indicating the source of each listing, added checkboxes for users to filter by job board for new searches as well as current data, improved performance from 20s to 3s, added "read more" feature for users to read the full html description.

**Thoughts**: Wow, I made a ton of progress today. It really helps me to make daily goals. It holds me accountable and helps me keep my breaks short during the day. It's really easy to just scroll through reddit, hacker news, google for an hour at a time, and by the end of the day I don't accomplish much even though I was "working" all day. The most interesting part of the day was figuring out how to improve my performance from 20s to 3s. I should write a blogpost about that some day. I knew that it was the wrong move to chain my promises, so that I was running them all in series, but I just now found out about Promise.all() which is really amazing. In order for it to work for this project I had to do nested Promise.all()'s which was also pretty cool. Also, I decided that I'm not going to use passport.js + mysql for this web app. Instead, I'm going to add it to StockIT. I originally wanted to do it for this project mostly, so that I could learn passportjs and mysql...it wouldnt have a major use for this project. I realized today that it would be really cool if, for StockIT, I kept track of everyone's score and put it on a user leaderboard. maybe even included the AI on the leaderboard, and maybe a random AI too. That would be a fun experiment!

### Day 198: December 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added hackernews postTime and stack overflow postTime, removed the "reply" link on the hacker news html descriptions, tweaked some of the regex for finding technologies in the descriptions. Added read more all button so that the user can easily ctrl+f the page.

**Thoughts**: I didn't get as much done today as I had hoped, but oh well. Improving the technology finder is one of those things that always takes longer than you imagine. There are a bunch of technologies, and many of them have common names (how can you possibly search for Go and know if it's the language or not???). I wish I could do more with the hacker news posts. Unfortunately, the data is not clean at all. All I have left to do before cleaning up the design, hosting to heroku, and fixing for mobile, is adding sort/filter features, filter out hacker news posts by location, tweak the tech finder, and perhaps tweak rankScore(). Overall, I am pretty happy with my progress, but I'm not certain that I will finish before I leave for vacation.

### Day 199: December 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Improved regex for searching text for technologies. Planned out flow control for location gathering and filtering.

**Thoughts**: Didn't push a ton of code because most of it was thinking and testing, but I am pretty happy with the current state. Moved on to the next issue, using Google Maps API to get coordinates for HN and user search location. In planning how I want to do this, I realized a couple things. 1) The API looks super easy to use which is nice. 2) I need to have a better handle on Promise flow control. I came up with a plan that only executes code synchronously if it absolutely has to, and I think I came up with a way to write this in code. I have a plan, and now all I need to do is execute. I plan to wake up early, maybe 4:30AM (even though it's almost 1AM right now) to execute my plan. I know I will run into issues due to the fact that the data is super dirty but I'll do what I can. Unfortunately, this web app won't be clean cut like the others; however, it should be pretty useful to people, so we'll see.

### Day 200: December 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Really improved the control flow. Changed from using Promises to async library (async.series and async.parallel) Finished implementing HN filter by location, but I had to stop testing due to Google API limitations.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting close! I can taste it. I may have to refactor my code, so that I don't keep running up against Google API limits. I'm going to have to ramp up my coding if I want to finish this app and work on my blog/portfolio while I'm on vacation.

### Day 201: December 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended Real World React Meetup at Brigade

**Thoughts**: Met some cool people and learned some cool things! I think I've heard enough people rave about axios for me to give it a try. Watching these presentations makes me realize that I really need to clean up my code...and do testing...ahh there's so much to learn!

### Day 202: December 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed hn distance from user fn by changing lon to lng, filter by location works now

**Thoughts**: Couldn't code yesterday due to work + packing + red eye flight and I was suuuper tired today on vacation in chicago but somehow i managed to whip out the ole laptop

### Day 203: December 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: search works with no location entered

**Thoughts**: it's hard to get the motivation to code while on vacation

### Day 204: December 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: added batchelor, changed code to batch google api requests, worked on sort by post time feature, cleaned up css

**Thoughts**: Google didn't like all of my geolocation api requests and kees shutting me out. batchelor is supposed to make it easy to batch google api requests. once they let me hit up their API again, I'll find out if it actually works. my sister (industrial designer for MNML) mentioned she would want to collaborate on a project and would be willing to help me with the design!

### Day 205: December 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Opened up my new XPS 13 9360 pre-loaded with ubuntu, worked on a bunch of issues

**Thoughts**: At first was really slow and laggy, so I updated ubuntu which seemed to help, but then computer started to restart randomly, eventually got to the point where it would get stuck in this boot loop where it would never fully boot before it shut down. Planning on calling dell support tomorrow

### Day 206: December 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Called dell technical support which didn't help much, reset to factory, still randomly rebooted, found out batchelor may not work for geocoding requests

**Thoughts**: Overall, not a great day. I might have to just pay for premium if I want to do that many google geocoding requests. Hopefully, I can figure out the random restart issue without wasting a bunch of time...

### Day 207: December 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Deleted batchelor code, created hn-scrape-bot, and created mysql schema with workbench

**Thoughts**: This google geocode query limit issue caused me to rethink this project, and I think I came up with a better plan. I have a separate node file that scrapes hacker news who's hiring every hour or so, parses it, and then saves it to a mysql db. The full stack web app never scrapes hn. Rather, it always gets data from the database. This will take a bit longer, but is definitely the better option. Workbench is interesting...who knew there was so much to a database application (hopefully no db admins are reading this). Next step is populating the db with my node bot, then hosting the db online.

### Day 208: December 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: hn-scrape-bot writes to mysql db hosted on AWS, hn-scrape-bot hosted on heroku scheduled to run every hour

**Thoughts**: I made a lot of progress today, but I still have a bit to go. I need to make sure that hn-scraper-bot actually runs every hour and that it runs correctly. Then I need to change jobSort() to read data from the AWS db. It takes a lot of effort to learn new tech; it's one of those things that is really easy to procrastinate. But once you get going you realize that it isn't that different from anything else you've done, and you just work your way through it. I learned mysql, aws, and workbench today. It doesn't seem like much, but it definitely wasn't easy to start the learning process. It did help that I read a success post this morning which brought out the competitive streak in me. After reading all these success posts, I need to convince myself that I'm learning/moving faster or I need to speed up. This was one of those that made me speed up.

### Day 209: December 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: jobSort() reads from AWS db, hosted jobSort() on heroku

**Thoughts**: As soon as I thought I was done with the backend, I found out that heroku's server is blocked from stack exchange. I'm going to have to think about how I want to handle this. I can call stack exchange and try to get it unblocked or I could move stack exchange code from server to client side. Stack exchange doesn't want people to scrape their website 

### Day 213: December 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up css, found out stack overflow can't be scraped from browser side, emailed stack exchange

**Thoughts**: I was reluctantly trying to implement the stack overflow scraping on the client side to avoid working around the fact that the heroku server is blocked from stack exchange, but then I realized that cheerio only works in node. So I resorted to sending the stack exchange team an email and working on the CSS. 

### Day 214: December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: cleaned up css, made app responsive, made favicon, fixed hn descriptionText issue

**Thoughts**: I am pretty much done now. Still waiting on a response from stack exchange regrading their blockage of my heroku server. really hoping they will just unblock it, that would make my life a lot easier.

### Day 215: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: disabled stack overflow checkbox, posted my 3 web apps to /r/webdev Share your Projects, fixed up and completed Udacity application

**Thoughts**: looks like im about ready to move on to fixing up codeclub.social.

### Day 216: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made loader, bought austintackaberry.co, hosted portfolio on github, added videos to portfolio, applied to a job!

**Thoughts**: Overall a pretty productive day. It feels good having a portfolio on my very own top level domain! It needs some work though...I really like how I have videos of my projects that are clickable and send you to the website; however, the resolution is horrible. I don't know if there's much I can do to improve it unfortunately. Tomorrow I'll continue working on my portfolio and touch up codeclub.social.

### Day 217: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a bunch of progress on my portfolio: recorded demos of my projects, made a poster for each video, added descriptions. Started to clean up codeclub.social.

**Thoughts**: Everything is kind of starting to all come together. I still need to work on my portfolio a little bit and decide if I want to add some crazy animations. I've been listening to a lot of Front End Happy Hour, and it's awesome. I could probably do a blogpost on that podcast it's that good. Once I finish touching up codeclub.social, I'll record a video and add it to my portfolio. After that, I'll be mostly preparing for interview questions! I have come a long way in 7 months; I feel like I'm pretty close to my goal and I still have 5 months. I'll definitely have to hit the books hard, but it's really motivating when I can say with confidence that every day I take a step in the right direction. Happy New Year!

### Day 218: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up codeclub.social, added favicons to codeclub and my portfolio, made portfolio look better and responsive, added minor animations, applied to some more jobs, scheduled 3 codeclub meetups

**Thoughts**: This weekend I spent a ton of time working on my portfolio, and I think it's coming together. Now that I received the go ahead to schedule meetups, I can take a look at the meetup cards on codeclub.social to clean them up, and then take a video and add to my portfolio. After that, I'll have to decide what to work on next. Hopefully, I will be able to get some feedback from professional SWEs and make a plan.

### Day 219: January 2, 2018

**Todays' Progress**: Cleaned up codeclub.social, added it to portfolio, made an anonymized resume, applied to some jobs

**Thoughts**: I need to find a way to get feedback on my resume and some advice on what I should do next. Maybe I'll start reading CTCI. Whatever I end up doing, I need to kick it into high gear.

### Day 220: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Improved mobile UX on jobsort

**Thoughts:** A new Hacker News: Who is hiring post came out today, so I posted jobSort() all over hacker news and reddit. This made me realize there was some "simple" things I could do to improve the UX, especially on mobile. I realized that the fonts and margins were too big on mobile, and there was valuable space that I wasn't using.

### Day 221: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Attended SFNode meetup, gave my pitch on 15 seconds of fame, cleaned up the code on my portfolio

**Thoughts**: I realized today that I should probably clean up my code for my projects before I do anything. It's not exciting, but it feels good to have a path forward. I was very nervous during my 15 seconds of fame, but I got a business card out of it!

### Day 222: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: fixed portfolio banner, fixed codeclub footer, made codeclub responsive, found out that chrome dev tools has an option for mobile testing...

**Thoughts**: I can't believe I just found out about the mobile option in chrome devtools, but I am really glad that I found it. In asking on reactiflux and reddit, it seems like my next move should be to clean up my project code. Tomorrow, I'll start with Yeggle.

### Day 223: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Met some cool people at oakland nodeschool, started cleaning up jobsort codebase

**Thoughts**: Really glad I went to oakland nodeschool...I have a lot to learn. After cleaning up my code, I'm going to learn data structures and algorithms.

### Day 224: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent all day cleaning up the front end of jobsort

**Thoughts**: It feels good finally splitting up my App component into multiple components and actually using props. Unfortunately, it takes a ton of time, but I know that it's good experience. It's going to be rough doing this for all my projects, but I'll feel a lot better about sharing my code when I'm done.

### Day 225: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Applied to 12 jobs, fixed jobsortio, made minor changes to portfolio

**Thoughts**: I need to set goals for January and stick to it. After refactoring jobsort, I'm not sure that I want/need to refactor my other projects as well. I think I should first apply to > 40 jobs, and then wait to see if I get any calls. That will help guide me towards my next move.

### Day 226: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Applied to a couple more jobs, made changes to resume requested by reddit

**Thoughts**: 2 redditors made some resume suggestions. One of the recommendations was a really good idea and something I hadn't thought about: separating my languages from technologies. They also wanted me to get rid of my full stack engineer title because they thought it would be limiting.

### Day 227: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cleaning up backend of jobsort, started reading about testing, attended wafflejs, was accepted to Udacity Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship

**Thoughts**: I found out that 100,000 people applied and 50,000 people were accepted to the scholarship, so not actually that exciting. Oh well. I need to work harder and learn more.

### Day 228: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

**Thoughts**:

### Day 229: January 12, 2018

### Day 233: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

**Thoughts**:

### Day 234: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: attended oakland.js meetup, discussed portfolio design with designer, completed udacity mockup project, finished applying to 50 jobs 

**Thoughts**: really need to finish this udacity/google pre-scholarship coursework so that I can move onto contributing to open source/ds&a

### Day 235: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Led CodeClub meetup, finished CSS section of Udacity GWG Challenge, fixed CodeClub.Social meetup cards issue, fixed jobSort() NaNw ago hacker news error

**Thoughts**: Hopefully I can finish the Udacity GWG challenge this weekend.

### Day 236: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on UGWGC, stopped working on UGWGC, planned out my learning path, configured jobsort testing with mocha, chai, and enzyme

**Thoughts**: Found out that there is no prize for finishing the UGWGC before April 11th, so I determined that I should work on something else now. I didn't know what I should work on, so I made a list on a whiteboard with post its to help me determine in what order I should learn each topic. I determined that I should learn testing first, then improve my projects, then learn redux. Mostly those are all in preparation for trying to contribute to the React project. After that, I will learn DS&A. Oh, I received an email from Ask Media Group trying to set up a time for my 2nd phone screen! 

### Day 237: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Attended code and coffee meetup, attended berkeley javascript dojo meetup, started writing unit tests!

**Thoughts**: Who knew that writing unit tests would be so simple to get up and running! My plan is to get to 100% coverage on jobsort...i should probably do that for StockIT too given that it's at the top of my portfolio project list. I need to redo my Goals by Month plan and think about how much additional time I need to allocate in order to reach my goals.

### Day 238: Janurary 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Planned goals by month, set up Travis CI, istanbul, and coveralls to automatically calculate my test coverage, upped jobsort test coverage to 60%, bought some TLDs for my projects.

**Thoughts**: Though unit tests are easy to get started with, they can be exhausting...especially if your code isn't super clean and you need to refactor it in order to get full coverage. I really want to get to 100% coverage, so that I can get the shiny badge, show it off, and move on. The only unfortunate thing is that my net step is to refactor jobsort with redux...which is going to mess up all my tests......
