# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0, July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned Git, GitHub, started cs50 pset8

**Thoughts:** Excited to start 100 days of code!

### Day 1: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading cs50 pset8

**Thoughts**: This pset looks really long and complicated but also really cool!

### Day 2: July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended CodeClub meetup, learned about branches in GitHub and a little bit of Ruby

**Thoughts**: Really need to learn my way around the command line more, so that I can navigate around Ubuntu more efficiently

### Day 3: July 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started The Odin Project! Learned how the internet works, learned more about git and GitHub, installed a bunch of stuff to start programming Ruby!

**Thoughts**: Not sure how I feel about learning Ruby vs Python for back end in general, but I am excited to learn Ruby to contribute to CodeClub meetup projects which will be done in Ruby.

### Day 4: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Chugging along on The Odin Project, getting more comfortable with git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

**Thoughts**: Still not entirely sure why the staging area is a useful feature in git. Someone on reddit recommended to minimize the copy-pasting when doing tutorials in order to help learn more quickly. I have been doing this, and I think it is great advice.

### Day 5: July 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended FreeCodeCamp meetup in Oakland, met some cool people, quit The Odin Project, started FreeCode Camp

**Thoughts**: Made some quick, important decisions today...Realized that Javascript is much more popular than Ruby for web development as of late (via indeed.com, reddit, and podcasts), thus the switch from The Odin Project to FCC. Plus, there is a weekly 6 hour FCC meetup in Oakland!

### Day 6: July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some solid progress on cs50 pset8. Almost done!

**Thoughts**: I'm all over the place...not sure if I should completely finish cs50 before digging into FCC or if I should just finish pset8 and leave the final project for later when I am more familiar with Javascript/HTML/CSS. It would be nice to finish cs50 and get it out of the way, but it would also be nice to have my final project be decent!

### Day 7: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished cs50 pset8!!

**Thoughts**: Feeling accomplished. I think I am going to go back to FreeCodeCamp until I feel capable of making my own cool project that I will use for cs50 Final Project.

### Day 8: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through HTML and CSS in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: I have heard good things about FreeCodeCamp, but I will say that I wish the challenges were more difficult. Because the answers are nearly spoon-fed, I don't feel like I am retaining as much as I could have. I am looking forward to the projects and developing a proficiency in HTML/CSS!

### Day 9: July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Participated in CodeClub meetup where we decided that we will focus on Javascript/CSS/HTML for our projects. Completed the HTML/CSS section of FCC and started Bootstrap.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap seems helpful and makes CSS manageable. I can't wait to get to Javascript and the first projects! Also glad that there is an Oakland FCC meetup to learn with others.

### Day 10: July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Bootstrap and jQuery sections of FCC. Read the first FCC project.

**Thoughts**: Excited to be working on projects! Really hope I can use my own IDE rather than codepen. I want to get comfortable working on my own setup and using git/github. Unfortunately, I won't be able to code tomorrow as I will be mountaineering at Mt. Shasta!

### Day 11: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started my first FCC project, making a tribute page for Craig Newmark.

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately, I was unable to code the last 3 days due to
mountaineering at Mt. Shasta (awesome experience) over the weekend and going
 to the A's game yesterday. I almost decided to not do the FCC projects but
 do my own projects, so that my portfolio is unique, but after googling others'
 experiences with FCC, the response is overwhelmingly positive. It is hard to
 find someone that has something negative to say about FCC. Then, I thought
 about doing FCC beta based on what I was reading on reddit, but they are no
 longer accepting new campers, so I decided to stick to the normal FCC.

### Day 12: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the tribute page. Started and almost finished my portfolio webpage!

**Thoughts**: I thought I understood CSS/Bootstrap when I was going through the
 FCC curriculum, but these projects have revealed some misunderstandings. Today I
 decided that my goal is to be employed one year after I started learning
 how to program (May 27, 2017) making the same pay as I do now.
 
 ### Day 13: August 3, 2017
 
 **Today's Progress**: Made minor changes to Portfolio webpage, made some solid progress on the Basic Javascript section.
 
 **Thoughts**: I can't wait until I get past the syntax and start doing cool stuff with Javascript. I also still need to add a nav bar to my portfolio page and then copy/paste my code into codepen. It's crazy that I've only been coding for a little less than 10 weeks. It feels like that was so long ago!
